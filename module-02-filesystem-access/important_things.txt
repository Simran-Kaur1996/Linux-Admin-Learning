IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER IN LINUX
=====================================

1. ROOT ACCOUNT â€“ SUPERUSER ACCESS
----------------------------------
- Linux has a special user account called **root**.
- The root user is the most powerful account in the system.
- It can:
  - Create, modify, or delete user accounts.
  - Access and modify any file on the system.
  - Change system configurations and perform administrative tasks.
- Use of root privileges should be done with caution.

------------------------------------------------------------

2. CASE SENSITIVITY IN LINUX
----------------------------
- Linux is a **case-sensitive** operating system.
- This means:
  - `File.txt`, `file.txt`, and `FILE.TXT` are all different files.
- Always be precise with uppercase and lowercase letters in file and folder names.

------------------------------------------------------------

3. AVOID USING SPACES IN FILE AND DIRECTORY NAMES
--------------------------------------------------
- It is recommended to **avoid spaces** when creating file or folder names.
- Instead, use:
  - Hyphens (`-`)
  - Underscores (`_`)
  - CamelCase (e.g., MyFileName)

Examples:
- Good: `my_project.txt`, `backup-2024`, `UserData`
- Bad: `my project.txt`, `backup 2024`

------------------------------------------------------------

4. UNDERSTANDING THE LINUX KERNEL
---------------------------------
- The **Linux kernel** is **not the entire operating system**.
- It is the **core component** that manages communication between:
  - The user and the hardware
  - The software and system peripherals
- It handles:
  - Memory management
  - Process management
  - Device control
  - System calls

------------------------------------------------------------

5. COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE (CLI) FIRST
-------------------------------------
- Linux is primarily a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** based system.
- Although some distributions offer a Graphical User Interface (GUI), most system tasks and configurations are done using the terminal.

Benefits of CLI:
- Faster operations
- More control
- Script automation

------------------------------------------------------------

6. FLEXIBILITY OF LINUX
-----------------------
- Linux is known for its **flexibility and customization**.
- Unlike many operating systems, Linux allows users to:
  - Choose and modify system components.
  - Create shell scripts to automate tasks.
  - Control permissions and configurations precisely.

------------------------------------------------------------

7. TYPES OF ACCESS TO LINUX
---------------------------

There are two main ways to access a Linux system:

A. **Console Access**
   - Direct physical access using:
     - VGA
     - HDMI
     - DVI
   - Common in data centers or local machines.

B. **Remote Access**
   - Connect to the system remotely using network protocols.
   - Common method: **SSH (Secure Shell)**
   - SSH clients:
     - Windows: PuTTY, PowerShell, or built-in SSH (Windows 10 and above)
     - Linux/Mac: Terminal (SSH is built-in)

Command to connect via SSH:
    ssh -l [username] [IP address]

Example:
    ssh -l simranjeet 192.168.1.10

------------------------------------------------------------

8. LINUX FLAVORS
----------------
There are many Linux distributions (also called "flavors"). Popular examples include:

- Ubuntu
- Debian
- CentOS
- Fedora
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
- Arch Linux

For beginners and system administration practice, **CentOS Stream 9** is recommended.

------------------------------------------------------------

STEPS TO INSTALL CENTOS 9 STREAM
--------------------------------
1. **Create a Virtual Machine (VM)** using Oracle VirtualBox or VMware.
2. **Download CentOS 9 Stream ISO** from the official CentOS website.
3. **Install CentOS 9 Stream** on the virtual machine.
   - Set up disk partitions, root password, and user account during installation.
   - Boot into the installed system and start practicing from the terminal.
